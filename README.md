This repository contains a few tutorial questions to  improve your understanding of basics of C programming. These questions are not my own and hence, appropriately creditted. 

# Data Structure
The file linked-list consists of all the functionals that are applicable for a linear data structure, hence a simple tweak and convert it into Lists, Stacks and Queue. Happy Tweaking!
